A Bengali parody lyrics marquee runs across the top of the home page.

Sections
There are three sections on the home page: Chef, Recipes, and Ingredients. Each section is mobile-responsive. Clicking on the View Recipe button for a particular chef or recipe redirects the user to a login page. Once the user logs in, they are redirected to the appropriate page.

Chef Page
The Chef page has a banner with an image on the right and detailed information about the chef on the left. There is also a list of recipes for that chef. Clicking on a recipe takes the user to a detailed page with the recipe's ingredients and cooking method. The chef's name is also a link that takes the user back to the chef's page. At the bottom of the page, there is a button to mark a recipe as a favorite.

Login Page
The login page has two buttons to log in with Google or GitHub. The user can also log in with their email and password. If the user does not have an account, they can click on the Register button to go to the registration page. The user must accept the terms and conditions and provide a valid email address and password to register. Once registered, the user is redirected to the login page.

Error Handling
If the user's password does not match the registration page or their sign-in credentials do not match the sign-in page, an error message is displayed below the register/sign-in button. If the user attempts to access a page that does not exist, a 404 page is displayed.

Conclusion
This website is easy to navigate and user-friendly, with several features to enhance the user experience. Error handling has been implemented to ensure that the user is aware of any issues that may arise.
